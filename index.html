		Ever loved a piece of music so much, you wanted to contribute to it? Or, how about wishing to start a Youtube channel, but worried about the commitment? Maybe, you have the will, but not the resources & you need others to collab and jam with.
	</p> <p>
		Well, that's exactly where <a class=bm>beatmix</a> comes in to play. Listen to audio clips sampled and uploaded by ordinary people in their college dorms, just like you. "Jam" with others around the world, as you watch the line of beats continue to grow, branching off into numerous other variations using a single audio clip. If this isn't modern art, what is? 
	</p> <p>	
		So hit up the 'LISTEN' tab, and then just simply collaborate by adding your own beats to the song. Perhaps, you want to create your own line of beats— use the 'CREATE' tab to begin a line of your own. Take part in making music—in its simplest form—today.
